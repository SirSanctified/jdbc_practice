# jdbc_practice
In this project I built a simple backend for a program that allows entering employee details in a database (mysql in this case). It is assumed that all employees earn ZW$50000 and fixed deductions are performed as well. The program also converts the net salary to US$. If you try to get an employee and provide the wrong employee id or password, you will be asked to try again. It is not a good practice to store passwords in plain text, they must be hashed first. Since the main aim of this project was to learn JDBC, i neglected the issue.
